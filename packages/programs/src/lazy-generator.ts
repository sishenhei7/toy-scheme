; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-with-current-continuation
; In the following example, call/cc is used twice:
; once to generate a "return" continuation as in the first example
; and once to suspend an iteration through a list of items:

(define (for-each dg lst)
        (cond
            ((null? lst) ())
            (else
                (dg (car lst))
                (for-each dg (cdr lst)))))

(define (generate-one-element-at-a-time lst)
  (define (control-state return)
    (for-each
        (lambda (element)
            (set! return (call-with-current-continuation
                (lambda (resume-here)
                   (set! control-state resume-here)
                   (return element)))))
        lst)
    (return 'you-fell-off-the-end))

  (define (generator)
    (call-with-current-continuation control-state))

  generator)


(define generate-digit
  (generate-one-element-at-a-time '(0 1 3)))

(display
    (generate-digit) " "
    (generate-digit) " "
    (generate-digit) " "
    (generate-digit))

; Every time the loop is about to process another item from the list,
; the function grabs the current continuation, and assigns it to the variable 'control-state'.
; This variable initially is the closure that iterates through all elements of the list.
; As the computation progresses, it becomes a closure that iterates through a suffix of the given list.
; While the use of "call/cc" is unnecessary for a linear collection, such as [LISTOF X], the code
; generalizes to any collection that can be traversed.
